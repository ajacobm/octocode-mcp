## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Required Software
- **Node.js**: Version 21 or higher
- **GitHub CLI**: For GitHub authentication and API access
- **NPM**: For package management and analysis


#### Install GitHub CLI & Login

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh
gh auth login

# Other platforms: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
# Open authentication in web browser and complete login flow
```

#### Verify setup
   ```bash
   # Check versions
   node --version  # Should be 21+
   gh --version
   gh auth status  # Should show authenticated
   ```

#### Configure MCP Client:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "octocode-mcp",
     "command": "npx", 
     "args": ["octocode"]
   }
   ```

### NPM Configuration
Ensure your `.npmrc` files are properly configured
```bash
# Check NPM configuration
npm config list
npm whoami  # Verify authentication for private registries
```

### GitHub and NPM Access

This tool leverages your GitHub and NPM access to perform comprehensive searches across repositories and packages. By utilizing your authenticated sessions, it ensures that searches are conducted with the appropriate permissions and access levels, providing you with accurate and relevant results. Make sure your GitHub CLI and NPM configurations are correctly set up and authenticated to fully utilize these capabilities.

- Configurable result limits for optimal performance
- Intelligent caching reduces redundant requests

### Authentication Management
- Seamless GitHub CLI integration
- NPM registry authentication support
- Organization-aware access control

## Best Practices

### Search Strategy
- **Start Broad**: Begin with general terms, then narrow down
- **Use Progressive Discovery**: Combine multiple tools for comprehensive understanding
- **Leverage Organizations**: Use your team's GitHub org for internal discovery
- **Cross-Reference Sources**: Combine code, issues, and discussions for complete context

### Performance Optimization
- Use specific repository filters when possible
- Combine related searches in single sessions
- Cache frequently accessed information
- Monitor API rate limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Verify `gh auth status` and NPM login
- **No Results**: Try broader search terms or different organizations
- **Rate Limiting**: Reduce search frequency or use more specific filters
- **Private Repository Access**: Ensure proper organization membership
- **NPX cache**: To reset the npx cache, you can manually delete the cache directory. The location of the npx cache can vary based on your operating system. Typically, it is located in the `.npm/_npx` directory within your home folder. You can remove this directory using a command like `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx` on Unix-based systems or by deleting it through File Explorer on Windows.
### Misconfigured .npmrc File

A misconfigured `.npmrc` file can lead to various issues, such as authentication errors, incorrect registry settings, or unexpected behavior during package installations. Here's how you can check and troubleshoot your `.npmrc` file:

1. **Locate the .npmrc File**:
   - The `.npmrc` file can exist in multiple locations, affecting different scopes:
     - **Project-level**: Located in the root of your project directory.
     - **User-level**: Located in your home directory (`~/.npmrc`).
     - **Global-level**: Located in the global npm configuration directory.

2. **Check for Common Issues**:
   - **Registry URL**: Ensure the registry URL is correct. For example, it should be `https://registry.yarnpkg.com/` if using Yarn.
   - **Authentication Tokens**: Verify that authentication tokens are correctly set and not expired.
   - **Proxy Settings**: If you're behind a proxy, ensure proxy settings are correctly configured.
   - **Syntax Errors**: Check for any syntax errors or invalid entries.

3. **View Current Configuration**:
   - Use the following command to view the current npm configuration, including settings from all `.npmrc` files:
     ```bash
     npm config list
     ```

4. **Edit the .npmrc File**:
   - Open the `.npmrc` file in a text editor to make necessary corrections. Ensure that sensitive information, like tokens, is not exposed in version control.

5. **Test Configuration**:
   - After making changes, test the configuration by running a simple npm command, such as:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```
   - Ensure that the command executes without errors.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve issues related to a misconfigured `.npmrc` file, ensuring smooth package management operations.
